# How do infants think about and remember time information?
Currently a work in progress. Code for the project and the analysis can be available upon request. This project uses eye-tracking and pupillometry to explore memory processes in infancy. Across many cultures, adults use spatial representations of time to help remember the temporal order of events. Notably, both children and adults remember temporal order more efficiently when linear, spatial cues depicting temporal order are. However, we do not know to what extent this memory advantage may be a product of our biology versus a cultural invention that develops through experience with cultural artifacts such as reading direction and linguistic metaphors. The present work investigates whether temporal memory in 6-month-old infants is also facilitated by the presence of spatial cues.
